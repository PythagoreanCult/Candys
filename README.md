# Candys
Candys stands for Cellular Automata Networks Dynamics. Is a flexible program to implement arbitrary topologies in a Cellular Automata model. Its main purpose is to simulate random memristor networks. These networks can be used as a reservoir in a reservoir computer setup to classify protein toxicity. The code is completely written in Java.

Sadly I do not have time to give a detailed explanation of the code. For further information check the PDF Candys.
